vocolourisation
===============

LaTeX template for colourising abjad (mainly Hebrew and Arabic) vocalisation (pun: *voc*a*l*isation-*c*o*l*ourisation).

It allows colourising each letter with one colour from a colour scheme ([Molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai), [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) and [Invisibone](https://github.com/baskerville/invisibone)).
